            Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Gast√≥n Amengual, I am a Senior System Engineering Student at the National Technological University in Argentina. <hr style="margin: 1rem auto 1rem auto;">    
            Since 2020, I focus on Data Science, more specifically, on Optimization, Machine Learning, Modeling, Simulation, and Statistics, implementing everything I learn using Python and Jupyter Notebook. <br/> My current goal is to learn the most common algorithms, models, and techniques in those areas, but not importing them in functions and measure the precision and recall of the results, but rather understanding how they work applying them from scratch. <br/> For the future, once I have graduated from University, I plan to make a career in Data Science in the business world, more precisely, in the medical field, and also to do a Ph.D. in Data Science.<hr style="margin: 1rem auto 1rem auto;">  
            On this website, I show my <a href="pages/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>, where I describe both complete and on-going projects, along with my <a href="categories.html">articles</a>, which are Jupyter Notebooks on the Data Science topics and concepts I have studied.<hr style="margin: 1rem auto 1rem auto;">
