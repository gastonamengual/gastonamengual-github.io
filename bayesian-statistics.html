<h1>1 Definition</h1>
<p>Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the interpretation of probability proposed by Thomas Bayes.</p>
<h2>1.1 Bayesians vs Frequentists</h2>
<p>Frequentists assume that probability is the long-run frequency of events. For example, the probability of plane accidents under a frequentist philosophy is interpreted as the long-term frequency of plane accidents. This makes logical sense for many probabilities of events, but becomes more difficult to understand when events have no long-term frequency of occurrences, like for instance the outcome of a presidential elections, which only happens once. To solve this problem, frequentists invoke alternative realities and say the frequency of occurrences across all these realities defines the probability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bayesians interpret a probability as measure of belief or confidence of an event occurring. A probability is a summary of an opinion. An individual who assigns a belief of 0 to an event has no confidence that the event will occur; while assigning a belief of 1 implies that the individual is absolutely certain of an event occurring. Beliefs between 0 and 1 allow for weightings of other outcomes. This definition agrees with the probability of a plane accident example, for having observed the frequency of plane accidents, an individual's belief should be equal to that frequency, excluding any outside information. Similarly, under this definition of probability being equal to beliefs, it is meaningful to speak about probabilities (beliefs) of presidential election outcomes: how confident is a person that candidate A will win? This philosophy of treating beliefs as probability is natural to humans, which employ it constantly as they interact with the world and only see partial truths, but gather evidence to form beliefs.</p>
<p>If frequentist and Bayesian inference were programming functions, with inputs being statistical problems, then the two would be different in what they return to the user. The frequentist inference function would return a number, representing an estimate (typically a summary statistic like the sample average etc.), whereas the Bayesian function would return probabilities.</p>
<p>As the evidence approximates infinity, statistical frequentist inference is more or less objective and the Bayesian results often align with it. However, for small pieces of evidence, statistical inference is much more unstable, as frequentist estimates have more variance and larger confidence intervals. Is in this cases where Bayesian analysis excels. By introducing a prior, and returning probabilities instead of a scalar estimate, the uncertainty that reflects the instability of statistical inference of small evidence is preserved.</p>
<h2>1.2 Prior Probability Distribution</h2>
<p>The prior <span class="math">\(P(A)\)</span> of an uncertain quantity is the probability distribution that expresses one's belief about this uncertain quantity before some evidence is taken into account. A prior can be determined from past information (such as previous experiments), from the purely subjective assessment of an experienced expert, or an <strong>uninformative prior</strong> can be created to reflect a balance among outcomes when no information is available. An <strong>informative prior</strong> expresses specific, definite information about a variable. The prior belief is not completely discarded after seeing new evidence X, but it is re-weighted to incorporate the new evidence (i.e.more weight or confidence is put on some beliefs versus others), as more evidence is acquired, the prior belief is washed out by the new evidence. </p>
<h2>1.3 Likelihood Function</h2>
<p>The likelihood measures the goodness of fit of a statistical modal to a sample of data for given values of the unknown parameters. It is the probability of the the evidence <span class="math">\(X\)</span> given the parameters <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> : <span class="math">\(P(X | \theta)\)</span>.</p>
<h2>1.4 Posterior Probability Distributions</h2>
<p>The posterior probability distribution is the probability distribution of an unknown quantity, treated as a random variable, conditional on the evidence obtained from an experiment or survey. It is the probability of the parameters <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> given the evidence <span class="math">\(X\)</span>: <span class="math">\(P(\theta | X)\)</span>.</p>
<h2>1.5 Bayesian inference</h2>
<p>In the real world, the parameters that generated the data are hidden, as only the random variable is seen. One must go backwards to try and determine the parameters. The problem is difficult because there is no one-to-one mapping from the variables to the parameters. Many different methods have been created to solve the problem of estimating them, but since they are never actually observed, it cannot be said for certain which method is best.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference is concerned with beliefs about what the parameters might be. Rather than try to guess them exactly, a probability distribution is assigned to them, interpreting probabilities as beliefs.</p>
<p>Three things take part in the bayesian model:</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p><strong>A generative model</strong>: computer program, mathematical expression or set or rules that can be fed fixed parameter values to generate simulated data. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Parameters</em> <span class="math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <em>Generative model</em> <span class="math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <em>Data</em> (Generate Data from Parameters)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parameters</em> <span class="math">\(\leftarrow\)</span> <em>Generative model</em> <span class="math">\(\leftarrow\)</span> <em>Data</em> (Find the Parameters that could have Generated the Data)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Priors</strong></p>
<h1>2 Coin Flip Example</h1>
<p>Suppose that the probability of heads <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in a coin flip is unknown. The Likelihood function is given by the Bernoulli distribution. The unknown parameter is the <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and the conjugate prior distribution is Beta. The posterior hyperparameters are given by <span class="math">\(\alpha + \sum x_i\)</span> and $\beta + n - \sum x_i $</p>

<p>As more evidence is collected, the posterior distribution starts to shift and move around to eventually get closer around the true value of <span class="math">\(p = 0.5\)</span>. The plots are not always peaked at 0.5, as there is no reason it should be, for it was assumed that there was not a prior opinion of what <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is. As more data accumulates, more and more probability will be assigned at <span class="math">\(p=0.5\)</span>, though never all of it.</p>
<h1>3 Study Case - Swedish Fish</h1>
<p>Swedish Fish Incorporated is the largest Swedish company delivering fish by mail order. They are now trying to get into the lucrative Danish market by selling one year Salmon subscriptions. The marketing department have done a pilot study and tried the following marketing method:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(A \rightarrow\)</span> <em>Send a mail with a colorful brochure that invites people to sign up for a one year salmon subscription.</em></p>
<p>The number of subscribers is a random variable which distributes according to the Binomial distribution are taken, with <span class="math">\(n=\)</span><em>mails sent</em> and <span class="math">\(p=\)</span><em>sign in rate</em>. The unknown sign in rate will be estimated using a bayesian approach.</p>
<p>The marketing department sent out 16 mails of type A. 6 Danes that received a mail signed up for one year of salmon and marketing now wants to know how good method A is.</p>
<p>A Bayesian model that answers the question <em>What would the rate of sign-up be if method A was used on a larger number of people?</em> will be built. First, an uninformative prior distribution (i.e. a uniform standard distribution) for the rate is generated. Then, different samples from the Binomial distribution are taken, with <span class="math">\(n=16\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p=\)</span><em>values from prior distribution</em>. The posterior distribution is built with the prior distribution values which produced the observed number of subscribers. </p>

<p>Unlike to what would have been using a frequentist approach, bayesian analysis' answer is not a single number, but a distribution over probable rates of sign-up. The 95% credible interval calculated states that the rate will be between approximately 18% and 60% with 95% probability.</p>
<p>Now, the marketing department have done a pilot study and tried two different marketing methods:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(A \rightarrow\)</span> <em>Sending a mail with a colorful brochure that invites people to sign up for a one year salmon subscription.</em></p>
<p><span class="math">\(B \rightarrow\)</span> <em>Sending a colorful brochure that invites people to sign up for a one year salmon subscription and that includes a free salmon.</em></p>
<p>The marketing department sent out 16 mails of type A and 16 mails of type B. Six Danes that received a mail of type A signed up for one year of salmon, and ten Danes that received a mail of type B signed up!</p>
<p>The marketing department now wants to know which method should we use, A or B.</p>
<p>Although A and B may seem independent variables, their relation will be assumed unknown, as in many other application it cannot be known if two variables are dependent or not. Therefore, for a prior value to be included in the posterior, both simulated values must be equal to the observed data.</p>

<p>Suppose now that the manager states that <em>the sign up rate has never been higher than 20% and it's usually between 5% and 15%</em>. The natural place to include this information is in the prior, what the model knows about the sign up rate before processing the data. Then, the prior must be changed from a non-informative uniform prior to a more informative distribution that favors values between 5% and 15%. A Beta distribution with <span class="math">\(\alpha=3, \beta=25\)</span> will be chosen.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the more data, the less the prior matters. With enough data, the prior would not matter at all. The less data, the more the posterior distribution looks like the prior distribution.</p>

<h1>4 Inferring Behaviour from Text-message Data</h1>
<p>Given a daily text-message counts from a user, it sought to know if the user's text-messaging habits have changed over time, either gradually or suddenly.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C_i \sim Poisson(\lambda)\)</span> be the day i's text-message count a random variable. <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is unknown. Let us assume that on some day during the observation period <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> suddenly increases to a higher value. So, there are two parameters:</p>
<div class="math">$$\lambda = \left\{\begin{matrix} \lambda_1 &amp; \text{if} \; t &lt; \tau \\ \lambda_2 &amp; \text{if} \; t \geq \tau &amp; \end{matrix}\right.$$</div>
<p>The problem is to infer the unknown parameters <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>s. To use Bayesian inference, prior probabilities must be assigned to both parameters. As they must be positive numbers, the exponential distribution is chosen to model these parameters. However, the exponential distribution takes a parameter of its own, which will be called <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$\lambda_1 \sim Exp(\alpha_1)$$</div>
<div class="math">$$\lambda_2 \sim Exp(\alpha_2)$$</div>
<p><span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a hyper-parameter, as it influences other parameters. A good rule of thumb is to set the exponential parameter equal to the inverse of the average of the count data.</p>
<p>The switchpoint <span class="math">\(\tau \sim DiscreteUniform(1, 70)\)</span></p>
